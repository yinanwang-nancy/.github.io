            Climate change, the shortage of cheap clean energy and water resources not only threaten the survival of human civilization, but also threaten the sustainable social development and prosperity of the world. Nuclear energy is considered to be the future.<br></br>

            I work as a research engineer at the Centre for Ultimate Energy at ShanghaiTech University (a young university established by Shanghai Municipal Government and Chinese Academy of Sciences). The centre was launched to explore new research and development in the field of <a style = "color:blue;">nuclear fusion energy</a> and design an innovative Magetic-Inertial Confinement Fusion (MIF) Energy System.<br></br>

            <a style = "color:blue;">Coaxial plasma gun</a> is the key to this project and has been researched and developed for more than 70 years for a variety of applications, notably as a plasma thruster for space propulsion, creating a large and extensive physics and engineering knowledge base. 
            <br></br>

            As a research engineer, I am responsible for designing and optimizing the plasma gun, conducting pratical experiments to test the feasibility and working performance of the gun, developing the <a style = "color:blue;">vacuum chamber system</a> of each experimental platform and carrying out <a style = "color:blue;">computational simulation</a> of the physics process and structurak analysis using USim and ANSYS. I am also involved in other physics experiments: Spark-gap switch, Argon Preionization, High energy density capacitors, etc.

            <h4 class="titulo-delay">Previous studies on PJMIF</h4>
            <p class="descricao-delay">
              
              PJMIF is one of several possible embodiments of magneto-inertial fusion, an emerging class of modern fusion approaches. It is the only embodiment that has the unique combination of standoff implosion and high implosion velocity (50 km/s - 150 km/s). It uses plasma guns for all plasma formation and implosion. It has potential for relatively high repetition rate from 1 to 2 Hz. <br></br>

              Plasma jets for forming liners for near-term experiments in PJMIF needs to be compact, dense, high-velocity, high-Mach-number plasma jets:<br></br>

              - Velocity ~ 50 km/s<br></br>
              - Atomic density > 10^16 per cc<br></br>
              - Mach number > 10<br></br>
              - Jet-to-jet jitter < 200 ns<br></br>
              - Jet-to-jet mass variations < 5%<br></br>

              In magneto-inertial fusion (Figure 1), a magnetized plasma target is imploded by a material shell, called a liner. The target plasma is preheated to a sufficiently elevated temperature, typically ∼ 100−300 eV (about 1 - 3 million degrees Kelvin), so that radial convergence of the liner-on-target implosion may be limited to be less than 10 to limit the degree of hydrodynamic instabilities during the implosion. The liner may be solid, liquid or gaseous, and is used to compress the magnetized plasma target.Sometimes a cold fuel layer is used to boost the fusion gain of the configuration. MIF is indeed a hybrid of magnetic and inertial fusion.<br></br>

            <h4 class="titulo-delay">Plasma Gun Design (Patent Application in progress)</h4>
            <p class="descricao-delay">
            The plasma gun, also known as an electromagnetic launcher (or Magnetoplasmadynamic thruster / argon thruster), consists of three main sections: Gun electrode, Gas Valve and Main Capacitor Bank at the rear end. I am responsible for designing the <a style = "color:blue;">Gas Valve</a> and the <a style = "color:blue;">Gun electrodes</a>. <br></br>

            The Gas Valve is the key part of the gun. Its working principle is the use of an electromagnetic coil to drive the flyer plate up and down to realize opening and closing functions; in the meantime, a small amout of Argon gas is dispensed into the electrodes, followed by a pre-ionization, and then launched in the form of a hypersonic plasma jet. The plasma gun uses the Lorentz force to generate thrust. The electric charge flowing through the plasma in the presence of a magnetic field causes the plasma to accelerate at a relatively high velocity.<br></br>
            
            Under the supervision of Prof. Thio, I developed an <a style = "color:blue;">all-new gas valve design</a> for STG1. The original reciprocating valve is updated to an innovative <a style = "color:blue;">unidirectional valve</a>. This new design reduces the valve's opening time from <a style = "color:blue;">300μs</a> down to <a style = "color:blue;">150-200μs</a> based on simulation results and precise Laser Displacement Sensor (by KEYENCE) testing results.  <br></br>

            This state-of-the-art plasma gun was designed based on careful <a style = "color:blue;">production engineering</a> analysis.<br></br>

            • Material selection (Al2024, Titanium, Tungsten, Copper, Alumina ceramics, HDPE, PC, Teflon, Peek, etc.)<br></br>
            • Manufacturability<br></br>
            • Fabrication simplicity<br></br>
            • Machining processing methods<br></br>
            • Surface treatment (Anodic oxidation / Annealing)<br></br>
            • Machining accuracy<br></br>
            • Easy assembly     <br></br>      
            • Surface quality<br></br>
            • Cost performance<br></br>

            <h4 class="titulo-delay">Vacuum Chamber System Design</h4>
            <p class="descricao-delay">
            Apart from the plasma gun development, I also designed and set up TWO vacuum chamber systems: one for the Gas Valve & Pre-ionization Platform; the other for the Gun Development Platform. They were commissioned in January 2021 and June 2021 respectively and are now both put into service.<br></br>

            The gas valve & pre-ionization vacuum chamber is a cylindrical high vacuum test facility of 0.86 m in length, 0.5 m in inner diameter and 1 m in laser diagnostics height (centre of window). The Plasma Gun vacuum chamber is a larger cylindrical high vacuum test facility of 2.4 m in length, 1 m in inner diameter and 1 m in laser diagnostics height. They both use a combination of a dry pump and a turbomolecular pump from Edwards [UK] to achieve background pressures of down to <a style = "color:blue;">10^(-7) torr</a> for experimental purposes.<br></br>

            The purpose of the vacuum facility is to develop and optimize the state-of-the-art plasma gun design to produce a plasma jet with the optimal firing characteristics.<br></br>

            The two complete vacuum systems were all designed and developed <a style = "color:blue;">independently</a> by myself, including the main vacuum tank, quartz window, CF/KF/ISO flanges, vacuum gauges (ionization gauge & Pirani gauge), feedthroughs for BNC and optic fibre, vacuum pumps, digital control console, cooling water system, gas supply system, etc. <br></br>

            <p class="descricao-delay">
              To verify the analytical results, we conducted 2D MHD modeling using the code in USIM. The 2D MHD modeling results and the analytical results have excellent agreement.<br></br>

              USIM used in two-dimensional simulation is a computational fluid dynamics simulation program for supersonic flow and magnetohydrodynamics. It uses the finite volume method to solve the plasma flow problem.<br></br>

              In addition, while reading the NRL PLASMA FORMULARY (2016) done by the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory, I took the initiative to compile a parameter calculator for plasma physics, covering physical constants, fundamental plasma parameters and ionospheric parameters. The calculator is still under more detailed and precise modification. Any comments or suggestions are always welcome! The latest version was updated on 20th April 2022.<br></br>

              I am currently learning coding using Python in my spare time and I wish to apply it with my research in nuclear energy. I belive that coding is always essential for any research topic and it makes data science more efficient.

              The light-water reactor is the most common type of thermal-neutron reactor that uses normal water as its coolant and neutron moderator and a solid form of fissile elements is used as the fuel.<br></br>

              🔸 🔸 🔸 🔸 🔸 <b>Small Modular Reactors (SMRs)</b> 🔸 🔸 🔸 🔸 🔸 <br></br>


              Due to the cost and scale of Conventional reactors, they are 1) Too big to fund 2) Too slow to construct to meet power market needs 3) Too expensive to make nuclear energy competitive; thus, SMRs based on LWR technology are being considered now.<br></br>


              Production engineering plays an important role in SMR Economics. The complete process is first getting stuff into a factory, getting the best tools and techniques, repeating things again and again, and the costs are fallen (also known as fordism). It has nothing to do with the product size (ranging from large steam turbines down to domestic cookers).<br></br>

              Things that are smaller intrinsically cost a bit more, which is called the Diseconomics of small scale (or the Economics of large scale). In the last 40 years, every vendor has tried to solve economic problems by making the same design they had but a bit bigger, from 300MW to 1500MW or more.<br></br>

              Therefore, to deal with SMMRs, we need to offset this issue by investigating the spectrum (relationship) between the factors of scaling and the cost of production engineering.<br></br>

              - Standardization<br></br>
                Designing every power plant as a unique plant incurring lots of on-site design costs and regulatory costs. SO design it once like what we do in factories.<br></br>

              - Modularization<br></br>
                Much better productivity<br></br>

              - Relatively large program<br></br>


              Based on R&D, 300 MW seemed to be a sweet spot between the economics of scale and the ability to modularization <br></br>

              🟢 Low Enriched Uranium Space Reactors <br></br>

              The Federal Government (NASA, DOE) began to show interest in low enriched uranium (LEU) reactors for space power and propulsion in 2018. Based on the research done by Prof David Lee Black, the LEU reactors can be designed to meet mission requirements of lifetime and operability. However, there are still challenges we need to look into, such as the added weight of payload, politics of nuclear non-proliferation and reactor safety.<br></br>

              To deal with the penalty of the added weight on payload, mass-minimisation becomes vital. Based on research done by Prof Eugene Shwageraus and Dr Nathaniel Read (2022), "Results suggest sufficiently-good agreement for the WIMS-based methods to be useful in a full system massminimising optimisation routine." <br></br>

              🟢 Hall-effect thruster <br></br>

               A Hall Effect Thruster (HET) is an ion thruster in which electrons emitted by a cathode are trapped in a magnetic field, and used to ionize a propellant – thereby creating a plasma into the plasma chamber. The plasma is then accelerated to produce thrust, thanks to an electric field created between the anode and the cathode. It combines the high impulse of electric propulsion technology along with a very high thrust-to-power ratio.<br></br>

              Xenon is an inert gas. Unlike Iodine, Indium, Titanium, Mercury – Xenon can not react with the spacecraft. It means that the risk of contamination is much lower than with competing technologies.<br></br>

              HET has high flexibility, scalability and adaptability.<br></br>

              The VASIMR is a state-of-the-art rocket design that uses plasma for rocket propulsion. The concept was first developed by Dr. Franklin Ramón Chang-Díaz (former NASA astronaut) in 1979. Based on research at MIT and NASA, the VASIMR engine is 'a plasma rocket with 10 times the performance of a chemial rocket, using 1/10th of the fuel'.<br></br>

            <p class="descricao-delay">



            Modern AUVs are mostly powered by batteries, fuel cells or combinations of both technologies. They provide sufficient power for some missions, but other missions could benefit more with extended duration. Many institutes are carrying out scientific research on nuclear powered AUV designs.<br></br>

            Los Alamos National Laboratory developed a conceptual design for NASA in 2016 with the following goals:<br></br>

            • Non-proliferation issues<br></br>
            • Power level<br></br>
            • Size constraints<br></br>
            • Power conversion limitations<br></br>

            This conceptual design was sucessfully completed and they are pursuing further program development for Saturn Moon Titan Explore Submarine with NASA. The sub could be ready to launch in the 2030s for sea exploration missions.<br></br>

              🟠 【2022】 The UK-based JET laboratory operated by Culham Centre for Fusion Energy has smashed its own world record for the amount of energy it can extract by squeezing together two forms of hydrogen. The experiments produced 59 megajoules of energy over five seconds (11 megawatts of power).<br></br>

              🟠 【2022】 Generic Design Assessment (GDA) for the UK HPR1000 reactor technology was successfully completed by General Nuclear System Limited, with the issue of a Design Acceptance Confirmation (DAC) from Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) and a Statement of Design Acceptability (SoDA) from the Environment Agency on 7 February 2022.<br></br>

               

               🟠 【2021】 "In these experiments we achieved, for the first time in any fusion research facility, a burning plasma state where more fusion energy is emitted from the fuel than was required to initiate the fusion reactions, or the amount of work done on the fuel," said Annie Kritcher, a physicist at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) where NIF is based.<br></br>

               

               🟠 【2021】 Peach Bottom Units 2 and 3 (BWRs) became the second set of reactors cleared by U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission to operate up to 80 years (First time with such long life). That means these units will be providing 2,770 megawatts of carbon-free power in PA through 2050.<br></br>

            <p class="descricao-delay">

                    
               As nuclear is often labelled “expensive”, I researched the nuclear’s economy and reviewed authoritative data by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). In recent years, the US government was following the rule of 'Develop as many as different types of new nuclear power stations' and tried to find the optimal design with the best cost-competitiveness. This is one innovative way. Another way is through downsizing - 'Making things Small and Modular'. <br></br>

               Cost estimates based on the NuScale SMRs and the Westinghouse AP1000 Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR) provide convincing evidence that nuclear energy can improve its cost-competitiveness through constant evolution and standardized replication. <br></br>

               A number of companies, including Britain’s Rolls-Royce and GE Hitachi, are pitching to sell their products. However, the new SMR industry is still facing many challenges, among which cost containment is the biggest concern. <br></br>

               Research by the team led by Prof Tony Roulstone at Cambridge university concluded that if you used the same project techniques as for conventional plants, the SMR would cost (once the interest costs incurred in construction were taken into account) roughly 70 per cent more per kilowatt (kW) to build than the larger one.

                 ☺ Inspired by this, MIT Plasma Science and Fusion Centre (PSFC) is currently developing the real-world arc reactor, named as the ARC fusion reactor. This ARC fusion reactor has a conventional advanced tokamak layout but uses rare-earth barium copper oxide (REBCO) high-temperature superconducting magnets instead of copper wiring or conventional low-temperature superconductors used in ITER. But the design retains conventional D-T (Deuterium-tritium) fuel.<br></br>

              The first step is ideation, where I took time to think about what functionalities and features should be included, and what user experience should be like. With the goal of making people who don’t have professional music training have opportunities to experience a playful music-making process, <br>I decided to allow players manipulating the sound tracks.

              Before actually designing the UI, I sketched some drafts about the layout of the application. What I can confirm is that there should be five sliders to control the volume of each track; each track should have buttons to choose the sample sound; audio-visualizer is needed for creating a cool vibe.

            I did a preliminary user study, where I invited 10 of my friends to play with "More" Compiler. Most of they gave positive feedback and they stated that it is super fun to have more control of each track when listening to the music. I do believe that "interactive music experience" will be the trend in the future, since more engagement provides more engagement and give better music experience. <br></br> Through this project, the users can have a clear vision about how songs are composed because they can listen to different tracks separately, and then listen to all of them as a whole. However, this project mainly focused on recomposing "MORE", but not remixing it. In the future, we can try to remix the song by producing and creating different types of beats, changing the song to different speeds, and working out more suitable background music to suit the lyrics.
