            <p class="descricao-delay">
            
            The experiment facility is mainly consisted of three main parts: Fuel supply and preheating section, test section, and disposal section.In the fuel supply and preheating section, we have a supply tank, a syringe pump, and a preheater. In the disposal section, used fuel is disposed of properly with a filter, a cooling coil and a waste tank. <br><br>

            <a style = "color:blue;">The experimental setup contains:</a> <br><br>


            1) Fuel supply tank: This is where unused test fuel is stored safely at room temperature before experiments; <br></br>

            2) Syringe pump: Chemyx Fusion 100 Touch dual syringe pump (KR Analytical) is used to supply the test fuel into the oilbath (preheating section) through a coiled stainless steel tube; <br></br>
            
            3) A coiled stainless steel tube: Coppers Needle Works 1/8’’ * 25 gauge *2m 316 welded bright annealed stainless steel tube. The tube was coiled with a 420mm from the luer locking end followed by 6 rolls of a coiling diameter of 60mm using a cylinder. The length of the straight section became 450mm from the free end.<br></br>

            4) Preheating section: Memmert Oilbath ONE45L (Fig.6) is where the test fuel is being preheated up to simulate the working environment at the inlet of the nozzle.<br><br>

            5) Test section: This section was built up manually with a ceramic heating element (245mm, 400W, 230V ac), a reflector bracket (255mm), a selected metal plate (Al, wild steel, low carbon stainless steel). The ceramic heating element was connected to a plug using wires and can be easily monitored and controlled (switched on and off) using a K type thermocouple and a temperature PID controller (TC Direct (309-100) - 1/16 DIN (48x48x63mm deep) 1 alarm - Relay output). The metal support was designed and manufactured using wild steel sheets and Aluminium plates. The test section is flexible and can be adjusted into different angles.<br><br>

            6) iDS USB 3uEye ML high speed camera: To capture key features<br><br>

            7) Filter: To remove contaminants<br><br>

            8) Cooling coil: To remove excess heat<br><br>

            9) Waste tank: Dispose of used fuels recyling.<br><br>

            <h4 class="titulo-delay">Test section design</h4>
            <p class="descricao-delay">

            The test section was designed using CATIA. Firstly, I analyzed the minimum and maximum limit of test section dimensions and selected a suitable value in between. Since the test section is required to be flexible and can be adjusted at different heights and angles, I developed several designs and selected three possible ways to mount the test section. Considering design feasibility, simplicity, effectiveness and manufacturability, design option one was selected.<br><br>

            Besides, for any experimental setup being heated up to an elevated temperature, heat losses cannot be inevitable, but its effect to the system can be reduced using isolation tape covering the tube section where it is exposed to the surrounding air. This reduces the heat losses radiated to the surroundings and reduces errors.<br><br>

            Among all available stainless steel tube dimensions, 1/8'' * 25 gauge * 2 meters long was selected in my project based on existing rig designs and referring to our preference of the lab. From the specifications of Memmert Oilbath, we obtained the effective heating power transferred from the oil to the test fuel. Based on precise calculation and analysis, 2 m is the optimal length, and the test fuel has enough time from the inlet to the outlet of the tube. Enough time ensures that after the test fuel flows through the tube, its temperature can rise to the desired temperature before test fuel reaches the outlet. 1 m is too short, and the temperature does not have enough time to reach the desired temperature while 3 m is a bit too long, so the system undergoes greater heat losses and consumes more additional energy. <br><br>

              The first step is ideation, where I took time to think about what functionalities and features should be included, and what user experience should be like. With the goal of making people who don’t have professional music training have opportunities to experience a playful music-making process, <br>I decided to allow players manipulating the sound tracks.

              Before actually designing the UI, I sketched some drafts about the layout of the application. What I can confirm is that there should be five sliders to control the volume of each track; each track should have buttons to choose the sample sound; audio-visualizer is needed for creating a cool vibe.

            <p class="descricao-delay">
            I did a preliminary user study, where I invited 10 of my friends to play with "More" Compiler. Most of they gave positive feedback and they stated that it is super fun to have more control of each track when listening to the music. I do believe that "interactive music experience" will be the trend in the future, since more engagement provides more engagement and give better music experience. <br></br> Through this project, the users can have a clear vision about how songs are composed because they can listen to different tracks separately, and then listen to all of them as a whole. However, this project mainly focused on recomposing "MORE", but not remixing it. In the future, we can try to remix the song by producing and creating different types of beats, changing the song to different speeds, and working out more suitable background music to suit the lyrics.
