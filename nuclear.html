           Two Request for Proposals (RFPs) have been received from an aerospace manufacturing company. A number of centrifugal pumps are required, and your design team wishes to gain the contract to supply the pumps. There are not sufficient resources for the company to redesign and manufacture new versions of both the casing and rotor, so the decision has been taken to use the existing design of casing and to concentrate on improving rotor performance. It would be too costly to perform development work on pumps of realistic sizes, so the requirement is to design a rotor for a scaled model. Its performance can be measured on a test rig and, using dimensional analysis, a confident prediction can then be made on how the real-size version would perform.<br></br>

           <a style = "color:navyblue;" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VTkBuxU4yk">Request for Proposal</a><br></br>


           Pratt & Whitney Canada (PWC) is a world-leading aerospace manufacturer, with a history of producing aircraft engines since the 1950s. Our success is largely based on continuous innovations in product design and manufacturing methods.<br></br>

           In an effort to reduce the environmental impact of our products, PWC’s manufacturing branch has decided to redesign the PW100 engine in order to increase its efficiency. This is a turboprop engine, used primarily in short-medium range propeller aircraft. The main components are:<br></br>

            - Impellers : the current designs compress inlet air to a pressure of approximately 200 psi<br></br>

            - Combustor: the current design operates in an inverse flow combustion chamber<br></br>

            - Turbine: the current design is a two stage axial flow turbine<br></br>

            Our manufacturing plant has extensive capabilities and possesses state of the art technologies in nearly all manufacturing methods. The proposed designs will be evaluated equally on three criteria: efficiency improvement, and environmental footprint of materials and manufacturing processes. <br></br>

            <p class="descricao-delay">
             The software 'CES EduPack' is used to select the proposed materials for the engineering model of the impeller. Before giving any constraints in the software, all existing materials are shown in the diagram. Then, we add constraints to get rid of unwanted materials (grey).<br></br>

             The material selection process has the following 5 steps:<br></br>

             1) Translation step is to define requirements (functions, constraints…)<br></br>
             2) Screening step is to eliminate materials which cannot satisfy the constraints.<br></br>
             3) Ranking is a better selection with MPI (Material performance index).<br></br>
             4) Supporting information is based on a small scale of choices.<br></br>
             5) Final selection is based on practical factors (labours...).<br></br>

              The first step is ideation, where I took time to think about what functionalities and features should be included, and what user experience should be like. With the goal of making people who don’t have professional music training have opportunities to experience a playful music-making process, <br>I decided to allow players manipulating the sound tracks.

              Before actually designing the UI, I sketched some drafts about the layout of the application. What I can confirm is that there should be five sliders to control the volume of each track; each track should have buttons to choose the sample sound; audio-visualizer is needed for creating a cool vibe.

            <p class="descricao-delay">
            I did a preliminary user study, where I invited 10 of my friends to play with "More" Compiler. Most of they gave positive feedback and they stated that it is super fun to have more control of each track when listening to the music. I do believe that "interactive music experience" will be the trend in the future, since more engagement provides more engagement and give better music experience. <br></br> Through this project, the users can have a clear vision about how songs are composed because they can listen to different tracks separately, and then listen to all of them as a whole. However, this project mainly focused on recomposing "MORE", but not remixing it. In the future, we can try to remix the song by producing and creating different types of beats, changing the song to different speeds, and working out more suitable background music to suit the lyrics.
